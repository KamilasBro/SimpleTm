# About
My Task Manager project using Bootstrap/SCSS/React/Typescript with different state handling approach.
I created contextAPI and handled states using useReducer hook.

# Features
You can add/edit/delete sections and tasks within them.
You can also search for sections with tasks.
If you have more sections you can scroll them with your mouse horizontally.
Finally data is saved inside your local storage to emulate the backend.

# Future plans
The website will have completelly design overhaul aswell as adding some more features.
Currently the navbar buttons are not working at all so there will be some functionality added.
